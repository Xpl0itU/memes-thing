# memes-thing
Get memes from various subreddits and upload them to instagram

## Getting started
Configure everything you want in src/config.js, if you only setup FACEBOOK_APP_ID and INSTAGRAM_PAGE_ID you'll be set, but you can change the subreddits or the hashtags too.

You need an instagram business account linked with a Facebook page for this to work, weird restrictions of the API.
