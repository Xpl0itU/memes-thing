# memes-thing
Get memes from various subreddits and upload them to instagram

## Getting started
Rename .env.example to .env and put your Facebook App ID, you can also configure the subreddits and the hashtags in src/config.js.

You need an instagram business account linked with a Facebook page for this to work, weird restrictions of the API.
