# memes-thing
Get memes from various subreddits and upload them to instagram

## Getting started
Change the Facebook App ID to yours in src/initFacebookSDK.js and put your instagram page id (get it when logging in with Facebook) in src/handlers/instagram_upload.js.

You need an instagram business account linked with a Facebook page for this to work, weird restrictions of the API.
